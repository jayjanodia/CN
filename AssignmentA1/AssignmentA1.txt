		stuff is written on the crimper, and keep it inside till it's end is visible through the back of the crimper

Smaller, Dark Blue instrument is Cutter.
		Use the extremely behind, single razor to cut objects, the razor near to your hand.
		Use the front razor, the one containing two razors on either side, to cut the outer cable


		After cutting the outer cable, 8 wires should be there. Orange, orange-white, green, green white, blue, blue white, and brown, brown-white.. They should be interlooped with each other, so seperate them out, keeping them in the folowing order:
